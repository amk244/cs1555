
Grades - 
phase I - 27
phase II - 36

Some feedback/suggestions - 

1. Can use array data type to save stations/distance/stops on route / rail line table. This way order can also be maintained.
2. add reservation entity, this will help in counting seats reserved / available per train


(Note - These are not final grdes for the project, after submission and grading of the phase 3 of the project, final grades will be decided.)
